// Migrations no longer run on Render: Render's API connects as nura_app, which may read and

// production database's owner, BEFORE you push code that needs them. If that step is
// forgotten, the new code would start against old tables and fail on its first query that
// touches the change, possibly halfway through a checkout. So the server checks at startup:
// every migration in drizzle/ must be recorded in the database. In production it refuses to
// start otherwise, and Render keeps the previous version running.
