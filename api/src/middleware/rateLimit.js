/**
 * `by` optionally narrows the key: e.g. (req) => req.body.email counts per IP *and* email,
 * so one shopper mistyping their own password doesn't lock out a whole office sharing one IP.
 *
 * `ipToo: false` counts per `by` ALONE. Use it when `by` is an account that is already signed
 * in (2FA codes, the current password on the account page): otherwise someone holding a stolen
 * session could rotate through IP addresses and get a fresh allowance of guesses on each.
 *
 * `failuresOnly: true` counts only refused attempts (status 400 and up): five WRONG guesses
 * lock it, but an admin signing in correctly on several devices never trips it.
